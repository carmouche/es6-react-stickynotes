# es6-react-stickynotes
This is a small sticky notes app built in React.js that uses features of ES6, based on the sticky notes app found in Lynda.com tutorial exercise files. 

I was able to convert this app to use ES6 based on this tutorial: 

The React Way: Getting Started

For reference you can also find the original ES5 version in the /es5-original directory.
